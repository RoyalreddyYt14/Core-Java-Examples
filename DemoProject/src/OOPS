Object oriented program system(OOPS) or techinque or mehtodology:
object, class, inheritance, abstraction, polymor, encaspulation:

Object:   pen ( it is instance of an class) (blue print)
class: one kind template where it will have all variables, methods, constructor ...

Constructor: 
cons is ntoh but it is one special mehtod. by using this cons we instializa the data of an object.
how many types of con: 2 types: default con or 0-arg constr and parameterized constru
what is the use of default construc: to provide default values of an object
java compiler will provide this default constructor
constr name should be class name
constr does not have return tyep

1. if we do not have any constr in our class then by default java compile will one default constructor 
2. purpose of default con: to rpovi default values of an object

//java comments:

===================
Method Overloading: 
within the same class if we have more than one method with the same method name is ntng m overloading
Advatanges: 1. code resuability. 2. code optimization

Rules: 1. either by method paremertes order 
		2. no.of arguments within the method defination.

Ex: 1+1= functionality

add(int a, int b){
	a+b;
}

add(int a, nt b , int c){

	a+b+c;
	
}

===============
method overloing will comes under compile time polymorhship
===========================================

Practales: 

==============
+ operator overloading

1+1=2 //additon
"abc"+"efg"= abcefg// concatination
"manasi"+2 = manasi2
1+1+"hello" = 11hello or 2hello?

==============
this key work we can't use for static members(methods, varialbes

2 scopes: class level scope and object level scope
			static memsbers			instance memebers
			
========================================
Method Overriding: Inheritance: 
the sub class(child, derived) will aquire the behaviour and properites from super(parent, Base) is nothing inheritance.
Inheritance: IS-A relationship

=====================================
Super keyword means : will return super class object
Uses of Super keyword: 
1. we can call super class methods 
2. we use super keyworkd for parent varaibles
3. we use for consstructor
===================
Object
Class
Inheritance
Polymor
final keyword
 varialbes, methods, class
 
Abstraction: abstract and interface
Encapsulation
=========================
what is poly
types of polys? 2 types 
1. compile time poly
	method overloading
2. runtime poly or dyanamic method dispactch or dyanmic ploy
	ex: Method Overriding

//private, protected, public, default access modifieri--->
==========================================================================
Abstraction:
Hiding the implimentation(internal details) details and showing the functionality to the end user.
Ex:Mobile
Partialy abstraction(0% to 100%)
Fully abstraction(100%)
==========
How we can achive?
abstract class:
the class defined with the 'abstract' keyword is nt abstract class
rules: 1. atleast have 1 'abstract' method and abstract method will not have method body
2. provid metohd body(implemetation) in a subclass
3. we can't create abstract class object directly but by through the sub class we can create an object
4. by using abstract we can achive partiall abstraction(
5. abstract is kind of normal class only (we can defined a normal methods(concrete methods), constroc, normal variables)

interface:
1. interface is same abstract class but interface will have only abstract methods and public static final variables.
3. for interface also we can't create object direclty 
4. interface methods will impleteation in sub class
5. interface can't have normal methods
6. Interfaces will provide fully abstraction
7. Interface will support mutliple inheritance.
