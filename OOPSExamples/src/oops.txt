Inheritance: 
what is inheritance? (IS-A relationship)
parent class(super) child class(sub)


Benz(E, C) --  Car -->BenzEclass is a Car


Parent is Childrens 
types of inheritance?
5 types inher
1.single inheritance: 
Parent--> to--> child
2. Multilevel inheritnace: Grandparent -- Parents --child
3. Hierarcle hiner Parents --> 
4. Multiple inheritance: 

Father and Mother

Child

Multiple inherinatc is not possible when we use class
Interface --> multiple 

HybridInheritnace:


Parent --> Child1 and Child2
			
			SubChild1	SubChild2
			
			      SubSubChild3
extends keyword


super keyword: it will immediate parent class object
1. we can super keyword to different parent class varialbes and sub class varialbes
2. we can use super keyword for calling super class methods
3. we can user super() constructor 
//Abstraction(Poly)
this keyword: it is current class object

compile time poly and runtime poly:

Runtime Poly
Abstraction: 

Ex: Mobile 
2 ways in java:
1. abstract class( Partial abstraction)(0-100%)
   1. the class which defined with abstract keyword we will as abstract class
   2. we can define abstract method(Abstract methods does not have method body)
   3. abstract method implementation must provided by sub class.
   4. can have concrete methods(which we have a body will as concrete method in abstract class) and constructors and normal variables 
   5. we can not create object directly for abstract class(by through subclass only we can create an object of abstract class)
   6. Abstract classes does not support multiple inheritance.
   
2. interface (Fully abstraction)
	1.  the interface which defined with 'interface' keyword we will as Interface.
	2. We can have only public abstracts methods
	3.abstract method implementation must provided by sub class.
	4. implements keyword to maintain a relationship (IS-A).
	5. interface will also support multiple inheritance.
	6. We can't create a object directly for the inter(
	7. Interface does not have any constructor or concrete methods
	8. Interface can have public static final varialbes
	9. from java8 onwards, interface will have default methods
	10. functional interfaces( from java8)
	
Runtime Poly: Dynamic Method Dispatch
