Polymorphims
-- object //poly is nothing but one object can expose the behaviour into different ways(routes).
-- 2 types: compli time and Runtime poly
			
			Method overloading is comes under complie time poly
			
			
			Implementation
			
			functionality 
			
Abstr is hiding the implementation and showing functionality to the end user.

1. Abstract class(

2. Interface

50%

1. 0-Arguments same like default con
2. Parameterized constr


============
1. Constr must be same class name
2. 
3. Construc will invoke at time of object creation
4. Constroctor can overloaded. 1. Paremerters should different or no of agruments
5.this is used to differentiat local and global instance varaialbles
6. this keyword is nothnig current class object
7. this key will be used with in the class and can't use for static memebers
8. this can be object level uses
9 by using this() cons we can achive contr chaining
10. this() con must be the first statement
11. Method overlaoding?
	method name should same but the paramerts must be different
	we can achive me over with in class only 
	M O: 1. No.of arguments
		 2. by chnaing the parameters datypes
		 		add(int, int)
		 		add(int, long)
		 		add(long, int) //
		 		add(float, int)
		 		//Code optimization and code resuabality
