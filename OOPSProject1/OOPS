What is operator overloading?
- + / * ==

+ is the only 1 oper overl

In b/w numbers if we use + it will act as addition. ex: 8+8 = 16
In b/w Strings if we use + it will act as contination. ex: "Siri"+"Dhatrika" = SiriDhatrika

Ex: 8+8 = 16
"Siri"+"Dhatrika" = Siri Dhatrika
1+1+"Dhatrika"   =
"Dhatrika"+1+1   =
(1+1)+"Dhatrika" =
"Dhatrika"+(1+1) =
"Dhatrika"+(1+1)+"Siri"+23+24=
